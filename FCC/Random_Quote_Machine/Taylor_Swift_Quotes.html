      <span>No matter what happens in life, be good to people. Being good to people is a wonderful legacy to leave behind.</span>

      <span>There’s more to life than dating the boy on the football team.</span>

      <span>People haven’t always been there for me but music always has.</span>

      <span>You’re lucky enough to be different, never change.</span>

      <span>I think there’s something so attractive about mystery.</span>

      <span>Life isn't how to survive the storm, it's about how to dance in the rain.</span>

      <span>I've always been a hugger. If we all hugged more, the world would be a better place.</span>

      <span>If you're horrible to me, I'm going to write a song about it, and you won't like it. That's how I operate.</span>

      <span>Never believe anyone who says you don't deserve what you want.</span>

      <span>I remember seeing girls crying in the bathroom every Monday about what they did at a party that weekend.I never wanted to be that girl.</span>

      <span>I have to believe in fairytales and I have to believe in love.</span>

      <span>But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it.</span>

      <span>To me, “FEARLESS” is not the absence of fear. It’s not being completely unafraid. To me, FEARLESS is having fears.</span>

      <span>Love always ends differently and it always begins differently – especially with me.</span>

      <span>You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly. You have losses that you never thought you’d experience. You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it.</span>

      <span>It’s FEARLESS to say “you’re NOT sorry”, and walk away.</span>

      <span>There are no rules when it comes to love.</span>

      <span>When you have a long string of bad days you can choose to let it drag you down or you can find ways to rise above it.</span>

      <span>I think that there are so many different ways that someone can be beautiful.</span>

      <span>I'd rather be at home and eat ice cream than go out and get wasted.</span>

      <span>We always want what we can't reach.</span>

      <span>We should love, not fall in love, because everything that falls, gets broken.</span>

      <span>The trials and tribulations in your life make you stronger.</span>

      <span>No matter what you look like, there are days we all wish we could look like someone else.</span>

      <span>You pay for good days by then having bad days. You pay for joy with pain.</span>

      <span>In life, you learn lessons. And sometimes you learn them the hard way. Sometimes you learn them too late.</span>

      <span>The words you regret the most, are often the ones unsaid.</span>

      <span>I'm not fast at running. I'm not fast at any kind if sport. I'm fast at Trivia Games.</span>

      <span>I'm not afraid to write my feelings in songs.</span>

      <span>I'm intimidated by the fear of being average.</span>

      <span>I never want to change so much that people can't recognize me.</span>

      <span>Everybody has that point in their life where you hit a crossroads and you've had a bunch of bad days and there's different ways you can deal with it and the way I dealt with it was I just turned completely to music.</span>

      <span>To me, “FEARLESS” is not the absence of fear. It’s not being completely unafraid. To me, FEARLESS is having fears. FEARLESS is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, FEARLESS is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. FEARLESS is falling madly in love again, even though you’ve been hurt before. FEARLESS is walking into your freshmen year of high school at fifteen. FEARLESS is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again… even though every time you’ve tried before, you’ve lost. It’s FEARLESS to have faith that someday things will change. FEARLESS is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can’t breathe without them. I think it’s FEARLESS to fall for your best friend, even though he’s in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they’ll never stop doing, I think it’s FEARLESS to stop believing them. It’s FEARLESS to say “you’re NOT sorry”, and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is FEARLESS. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is FEARLESS. Letting go is FEARLESS. Then, moving on and being alright…That’s FEARLESS too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily ever after. That’s why I write these songs. Because I think love is FEARLESS.</span>

      <span>Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you'll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.</span>

      <span>Just be yourself, there is no one better.</span>

      <span>Giving up doesn't always mean your weak sometimes your just strong enough to let go.</span>

      <span>I write songs that are like diary entries. I have to do it in order to feel sane.</span>

      <span>I would love to continue in music, with writing... but I am not the kind of person who will hang around if I start to become irrelevant. If that happens, I will bow down gracefully, raise my kids, and have a garden. And I am going to let my hair go gray when I am older. I don't need to be blonde when I'm 60!</span>

      <span>I wish all teenagers can filter through songs instead of turning to drugs and alcohol.</span>

      <span>I love it when people say things to me in public and want to meet me, because I want to meet them! Early on, my manager told me, 'If you want to sell 500,000 records, then go out there and meet 500,000 people.'</span>

      <span>I haven't had that one great love, which is good. I don't want that to be in the past - I want it to be in the future.</span>

      <span>I have this really high priority on happiness and finding something to be happy about.</span>

      <span>I get really restless when I haven't worked for a day and a half. I have a recurring dream that people are lined up next to my bed, waiting for autographs and taking pictures of me!</span>

      <span>I believe when it comes to love, there's something intangible about who we are attracted to, and I don't think I have a pattern.</span>

      <span>I approach love differently now that I know it's hard for it to work out.</span>

      <span>I am an over-achiever, and I want to be known for the good things in my life.</span>

      <span>For me, when I picture the person I want to end up with, I don't think about what their career is, or what they look like. I picture the feeling I get when I'm with them.</span>

      <span>For everything I do, I think about a 6-year-old girl and her mom that I saw at my concert last night. I think about what those two individuals would think if I were at a club last night. I never want to be arrested, and I never want to get a DUI, those are my moral values.</span>

      <span>Fans are my favorite thing in the world. I've never been the type of artist who has that line drawn between their friends and their fans. The line's always been really blurred for me. I'll hang out with them after the show. I'll hang out with them before the show. If I see them in the mall, I'll stand there and talk to them for 10 minutes.</span>

      <span>Factoring in millions of people when I'm writing a song is not a good idea. I don't ever do it.</span>
